An updated, compacted version of the hands-on session originally presented at the [Advanced Processing of Biomedical Signals and Images](https://a-bip.pt/).

This time the venue was at the University of Coimbra at the [20th National Gathering of Biomedical Engineering Students (ENEEB)](https://eneeb.aneeb.pt/workshops-carol/).

This version includes our version of the [CirCor DigiScope Dataset](https://physionet.org/content/circor-heart-sound/1.0.3/) deployed to the HuggingFace Dataset Hub [HERE!](https://huggingface.co/datasets/miguellmartins/circor-digiscope-physionet22-processed)

This tutorial should equip any well-versed machine-learning practioneer  with the fundamental signal processing and deep learning concepts in order to solve problems related to phonocardiogram heart sound segmentation. 

We recommend running this package on a [Google Collab](https://colab.google/), but we also provide the files should you want to run the code locally.
