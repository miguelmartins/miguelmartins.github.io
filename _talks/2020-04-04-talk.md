An introduction to graph theory and how we can use it in modern network science to find emergent patterns in (almost) every type of data. With an introduction inspired by the [Network Science Book](https://networksciencebook.com/) and heavy focus on the [subgraph census problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgraph_isomorphism_problem).

The talk was aimed at an audience comprised mainly of data scientists and engineers.
